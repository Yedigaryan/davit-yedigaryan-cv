With over six years of experience, I’ve led projects like the Prestige Motors marketplace (2024), a high-traffic trading platform built with Angular and Node.js, serving thousands of users with real-time data. My passion lies in crafting intuitive UIs and robust backend systems, especially in fintech and eCommerce, where I’ve boosted performance and user engagement through clean code and innovative solutions.\n\nFrom my early days at Codeep building Blackcatcard’s fintech features to optimizing Blast.tv’s portal at Teracloud, I’ve honed my craft in Angular, React, TypeScript, and Node.js, while diving into PostgreSQL, CI/CD, and microservices. I thrive in Agile teams, collaborating remotely with global squads via Deel, mentoring juniors, and driving architectural decisions. My Master’s in Aerospace Computer Science fuels my problem-solving, ensuring I tackle challenges with precision and creativity.\n\nI’m all about growth—both personal and for the teams I join. Whether it’s mentoring colleagues, experimenting with AI-driven tools, or delivering apps that scale to millions, I’m here to make an impact. Fluent in English, Armenian, and Russian, I’m ready to connect and build something epic.
